CS115FinalProject
=================

This is a project for my CS115 Intro to Java I class. The goal was to create a service class and client program to read information from a file, create objects and store them in an ArrayList, and write methods to display certain data from the objects.

Our professor gave us a text file with information about electoral candidates. The candidates were listed by state. They had a few different attributes like name, office, campaign dollars spent, etc. I've uploaded the txt file.

I did this project in Eclipse. It's my first major Java project and I learned a lot, even how to use git!

If you'd like to test the project, use emilywarman.java and Candidate.java with the text files. ArrayListTest.java is an old version of emilywarman.java, but I didn't delete it because it has a lot of cool commit comments.
